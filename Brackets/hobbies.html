    <p>If you've read my "Skills" tab, you'd know that one of my hobbies/passions is my car and driving it. I currently drive a 2012 Volkswagen GTI. Since buying it, it's been through a lot. I beat it up a lot and I really wish I didn't. I have a high flow cat back exhaust and a APR carbon fiber intake. The reason why I bought a GTI is because it's quick, agile, and there's a lot of customizations you can do with them.</p>
    <p>Another hobby of mine is playing video games. At some point down the road, I would love to make my own video game and release it to the public. I have so many great ideas for them. </p>
