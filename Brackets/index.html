      <br>
      <p>I chose this image because I love my car and it looks great in the picture with the soap running off of the hood.</p>
      <h3>Audio Controls</h3>
      <audio autoplay controls>
            <source src="oceansounds.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>These are the controls of the audio file controling the ocean sounds that autoplay when the webpage is open. I wanted<br>
          controls to be able to pause the audio because some people could fine it annoying.
      </p>
      <h3>Purpose of Audio</h3>
      <p>The reason I chose this audio file is because I love the beach and the sound of waves is really relaxing to me.<br>
            Hearing the ocean noising makes me concentrate and I can really focus on the work I need to do.

      <p>Above is a circle made with SVG.</p>
        <script>
            var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
            var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
            ctx.font = "30px Arial";
            ctx.strokeText("VW GTI MK6", 10, 50);
