      <h3>Programming Related Skills</h3>
      <p>I have many skills that range from different things. A developing skill of mine is learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One of my favorite feelings in the world is to write a program that works. Although I don't have much experience as of right now, I am definitely looking forward to programming more in the near future.</p>
      <h3>Non Programming Related Skills</h3>
      <p>Other than having a passion for computers and programming, my next two favorite things are cars and travelling. My passion for cars has always been there since my Dad and I used to wash his cars all the time when I was young. Once I got my own car, I kept it clean as can be. I loved it. This car has been through a lot with me. A skill of mine with the car is learning the cars every move so you can corner it. It doesn't seem difficult but it really is hard. </p>
