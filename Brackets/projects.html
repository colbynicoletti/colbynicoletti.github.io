    <p><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> is something that I am new to. I bought a raspberry pi and made my own little computer out of it. I mainly did this because I will learn a lot of stuff from it. On top of the combination lock case, there's a solar panel external battery used to power the device. I use it all the time for taking to class as a smaller alternative to my actual laptop. I am going to continue to work with my raspberry pi to see what else I can do with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Building my own computer</strong>, with a budget, is something that I've always wanted to do. This summer I want to design it myself and custom build the case/stand for it. I also want it to have liqud cooling for aesthetic purposes. I am going to learn a lot from this project as it will be something that greatly infliuences me and my indended career path.</p>

        <p>Scratch is a website that I used to make a cool little plant game. I used Scratch so I could start to think like a programmer and I think that as time progressed, Scratch really helped benefit me.</p>

        <p>LinkedIn is a place where you put what education you have, intended major, where you think you want to work, what field you think you want to work in, etc. It allows employers to see exactly what you have to offer, along with what you prefer. It's a cool website to get your name out there in the job world.</p>
